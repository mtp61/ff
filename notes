\alpha is start weight (2)
x is min value increase for me (10)
y is min value increase for other team (0)
N is the max players each team can trade (1)

for trades to be legal need to improve my total value by (\alpha*start change + bench change) >= x, the other teams total value by (\alpha*start change + bench change) >= y, 


should only consider trades where each player trades at most N players
